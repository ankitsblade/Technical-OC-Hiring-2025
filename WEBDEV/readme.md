# Web Development Head
## Your task is to contribute to the official [Enigma Website](https://www.mu-enigma.org/) 

### Success Criterion: 

- **Fork the Repository & Set Up Your Environment** : First, fork the official mu-enigma.org repository to create your own copy. Then, set up your local development environment with the necessary tools like Node.js, NPM/Yarn, and a code editor to prepare for development.
- **Build the Backend API for Events & Blogs** : Create the server-side foundation for the new features. Build the API endpoints needed to create, read, update, and delete both events and blog posts. This will also involve setting up the database models to store this information.
- **Develop the Events Page**: Build the user-facing Events page. The page will source its information from a local data file  to display all of Enigma's past and upcoming events in a clear, organized layout like a timeline or a gallery. *( You can use dummy data for now )*
- **Implement the Full-Featured Blogs Page** : Create the complete blog section. This involves two main parts:
    - A **public** page that displays all submitted blog posts.
    - A **private**, user-only interface with a text editor that allows authenticated members to write, format, and upload their own blog articles.(authentication is required for now. Adding an authentication portal will however lead to brownie points)
- **Record the Final Demo Video**: Produce a short video **(<5 min)** that demonstrates the new pages in action. Showcase how the events are displayed and walk through the entire process of a user logging in, writing a new blog post, and seeing it appear on the site.

*Note - You are free to use any library or framework of your choice, make sure to clearly define them in your readme.md file and your video submission.*
