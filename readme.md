This document talks about the tasks involved for each leading role in the Enigma OC.

We evaluate your foundational technical understanding, implementation abilities, ability to tackle projects, and your ability to deal with realistic work while running and leading Enigma.

### General Points to Note
Some general points to note for any task, regardless of domain and focus, are:

Each task will have an in-depth discussion and questioning during the interview to ensure the legitimacy of your problem-solving skills and foundational theoretical understanding.

You are allowed to use any tool at your disposal ‚Äî GenAI, online resources, etc. However, you are expected to be transparent about the resources you used from the perspective of future members/enthusiasts requiring the same resources for their learning or efficiency for the same project.

All the implementations of these tasks are **NOT** expected to be perfect, a simple prototype with the minimal requirements is sufficient.

Your project must be open-source and submitted on the Enigma Repository, please follow the submission guidelines here 

### What is the video demo?
For each task, all heads are required to submit a video demo which is in the view of explaining the project to a person/member who wishes to replicate, understand or work with you regarding this project you have worked on ‚Äì a common scenario while working with a Computer Science community.

The video should be according to the stated requirements and cover the learning path, subject matter, resources, and project timeline. Demonstrate the project's functionality. While detailed concept explanations aren't needed, provide relevant resources. Discuss future learning prospects and potential implementations.
