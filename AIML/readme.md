## Your task is to create a Simple Neural Network without using any library other than NumPy.

### Success Criterion :

- Build the Core Network: Start by creating a simple, single-script neural network using only Python and NumPy. The goal is your network should be able to successfully perform classification tasks on a simple dataset.

- Create a Reusable Library: Refactor the initial script into an object-oriented, Pytorch-like library. The key is to create classes like Sequential to manage the model and DenseLayer for network layers, along with methods like `.add()`, `.compile()`, and `.fit()`.

- Demonstrate with a Real-World Problem: Use your new library to build and train a model for a practical use case. A great choice is classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset to prove the library's effectiveness and scalability.

- Create a Project Showcase Video: Produce a short (**<5 min**) video explaining the project. The video should outline the necessary learning path, demonstrate the library in action with the MNIST example, and discuss potential future enhancements like adding new optimizers or layer types.

***Note** : The MNIST Classification task is given for example purposes only. You are free to choose your own problem to solve using your library as long as you clearly define the problem and explain your approach.*
