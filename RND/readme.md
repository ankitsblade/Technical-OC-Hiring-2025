# Research & Development Head
## Your task is to provide a project pipeline and  innovative improvements for each comittee head task with proper R&D and logical backing.

### Success Criterion

- **Scope Foundational Projects via Literature Review**: Your first task is to scope all "from-scratch" projects (AI, Syscom, Cybersec) by conducting a formal literature review. This review will define each project's core architecture, phased milestones, and a specific, R&D-backed innovative leap to guide the teams.

- **Standardize Technology and Establish an R&D Pipeline** :  To ensure efficiency, you will standardize the technology stack for all web projects (e.g., MERN on Docker). You will also establish a formal R&D pipeline to systematically investigate, validate, and approve emerging technologies like Federated Learning for future use.

- **Frame Creative Projects as Formal Experiments** : You will structure high-uncertainty projects, like the game prototype, as formal research experiments. This involves defining a clear research question (e.g., "Can affect-based AI improve engagement?"), establishing quantifiable success metrics, and providing a theoretical foundation for the development team.

- **Direct the Strategic Communication & Showcase Video** : You will oversee all strategic communication by creating a centralized knowledge base for research findings. Finally, you will direct the production of the final showcase video, mandating a *"Problem → Solution → Innovative Leap"* narrative to effectively report the R&D outcomes and technical depth of all projects to stakeholders.
