# Game Development Head 

## Your task is to create a popular game mechanic with a major twist/quirk.

### Success Criterion

- **Conceptualize the Core Mechanic & Twist**: Choose a widely understood game mechanic (e.g., a platformer jump, a shooting system) and design an innovative **"twist"** that fundamentally alters its core functionality in a surprising way.

- **Develop a Playable Prototype**: Using a game engine of your choice **(like Unity, Unreal, or Godot)**, implement the core mechanic along with your unique twist into a simple, functional prototype that clearly demonstrates the concept.

- **Design and Implement a Showcase Level**: Create a single, well-designed level that effectively showcases the twisted mechanic. The level must be fully playable and thoughtfully crafted to guide the player through understanding and utilizing your unique gameplay concept.

- **Create the Project Showcase Video**: Produce a short video **(<5 min)** that demonstrates the prototype in action, explains the learning path and resources needed to build it, and discusses potential future prospects for expanding the game.
